# Browser dogfood acceptance

Status: **Passed baseline**

The local acceptance runtime used the fixed Swarm UI contract at port `8766`,
an isolated database and history directory, and three real Claude sessions:
Queen, Forager, and Pollen. No legacy or operator production data participated.

## Verified journeys

- First worker creation opened a usable terminal surface without a blank page.
- Nine alternating desktop selections preserved each worker's exact session ID.
- Reload stayed unlocked, restored all three durable worker profiles, selected
  the always-active Queen, and reattached the original Queen session.
- A task created through the API changed the open browser count from one to two
  without pressing Refresh, proving the resumable control-room invalidation
  path in the rendered app.
- Settings reported connected live updates and healthy API, database,
  terminal-host, and provider layers.
- The generated report included three session IDs and 11 recent content-free
  transitions while excluding the test credential, workspace paths, and worker
  names.
- Light- and dark-theme visual inspection found and fixed an unreadable
  light-theme diagnostic preview foreground.
- A 412 by 915 mobile pass found and fixed a hidden-worker-roster blocker. The
  compact mobile worker strip can select Forager, attach its original session,
  and remains available after reload.

## Development port contract

Vite now binds strictly to `8766`; startup fails instead of silently moving to
another port. This keeps local development aligned with the SSH and Cloudflare
mapping used by the dogfood environment. API proxy traffic remains on the local
API port `8765`.

## Remaining evidence

This pass proves functional redraw and recovery, not long-duration performance.
The multi-day soak, mobile terminal composition controls, and outbound feedback
submission transport remain separate promotion work.
